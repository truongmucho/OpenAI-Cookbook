    "Over the past few years, developers have encountered significant challenges when dealing with text data, despite the availability of rich resources such as `SpaCy` and other NLP libraries. These challenges persist due to the constantly increasing volume of data, which demands considerable human involvement, thought, and effort. \n",

    "In this notebook, we explored how to use the OpenAI GPT-3 model for NLP tasks. We used prompt engineering to guide the model to produce desired outputs, other NLP tasks such as POS tagging, sentiment analysis, and more can be performed using the same approach. This approach is cost-effective and efficient, as it reduces the number of tokens generated by the model, thereby reducing the cost of using the API.\n",
