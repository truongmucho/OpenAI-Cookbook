    "We'll create an agent that uses data from arXiv to answer questions about academic subjects. It has two functions at its disposal:\n",

UPD examines the\\nVLM's ability to withhold answers when faced with unsolvable problems in the\\ncontext of Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. UPD encompasses three\\ndistinct settings: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set\\nDetection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD). To deeply\\ninvestigate the UPD problem, extensive experiments indicate that most VLMs,\\nincluding GPT-4V and LLaVA-Next-34B, struggle with our benchmarks to varying\\nextents, highlighting significant room for the improvements. To address UPD, we\\nexplore both training-free and training-based solutions, offering new insights\\ninto their effectiveness and limitations. We hope our insights, together with\\nfuture efforts within the proposed UPD settings, will enhance the broader\\nunderstanding and development of more practical and reliable VLMs.\",\n",

PPO is designed to strike a balance between stability and sample efficiency in policy optimization. It uses a surrogate objective function that is updated iteratively through multiple epochs of optimization. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of PPO by comparing it with other popular algorithms on a range of benchmark tasks.\n",

       "- The paper proposes using heuristic search methods on the output probability distribution of machine learning policies to improve the performance of multi-agent path finding (MAPF) algorithms.\n",
       "- The main contributions of the paper are the creation of a \"smart\" collision shield using heuristic search and a neural network agnostic framework for using a learnt 1-step policy with heuristic search for full horizon planning.\n",
       "\n",
       "Evidence:\n",
       "- The paper discusses the limitations of current ML approaches for MAPF, which produce \"local\" policies that only plan for a single timestep and have poor success rates and scalability.\n",
       "- The paper demonstrates several model-agnostic ways to use heuristic search with learnt policies, which significantly improve the policies' success rates and scalability.\n",
       "- The paper compares ML-based approaches with classical heuristic search approaches and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.\n",

       "- The proposed method of using heuristic search with learnt policies improves the success rates and scalability of MAPF algorithms.\n",

       "- CS-PIBT is an effective collision shield that improves performance in MAPF problems.\n",
       "- The best way of combining the learnt policy with the heuristic depends on the specific scenario and can be determined through experimentation."
