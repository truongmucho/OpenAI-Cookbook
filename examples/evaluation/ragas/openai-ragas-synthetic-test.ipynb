    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Ragas is a python package and we can install it using pip\n",
    "- For creating QA pairs, you will need some documents from which you intend to create it. For the sake of this notebook, I am using few papers regarding prompt engineering\n",
    "- Ragas uses model guided techniques underneath to produce scores for each metric. In this tutorial, we will use OpenAI `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `text-embedding-ada-002`. These are the default models used in ragas but you can use any LLM or Embedding of your choice by referring to this [guide](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/howtos/customisations/bring-your-own-llm-or-embs.html). I highly recommend that you try this notebook with open-ai so that you get a feel of it with ease.\n"
