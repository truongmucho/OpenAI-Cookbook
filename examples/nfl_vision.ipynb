    "# Integrating Sensor Tracking Data with GPT's Visual and Leveraging GPT-3 Instruct with a Multimodal Chatbot Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook aims to interact with a sophisticated chatbot designed to assist users with queries related to American football, particularly focusing on offensive-defensive play strategies, and many more american football related things. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a note, for ease of understanding, we have retrieved the data from AWS S3. The complete source code with transformation of sensor tracking data is available at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Kush-Trivedi/nfl-vision/blob/master/data_visualization/matplotlib_game_visualizer.py). Additionally, for further reference, a detailed Kaggle notebook is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kushtrivedi14728/nfl-vision-the-ai-revolution-in-nfl-coaching).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Setup and Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prerequisite:\n",
    "    * Python 3.10 or later\n",
    "    - AWS Configured locally\n",
    "    - Open AI API\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- Initialization: Set up your environment by installing necessary packages (boto3, openai, tiktoken) and configuring access credentials for both OpenAI and AWS.\n",

    "## In-Game Actions with Actual Game Play\n",
    "During Week 7 of the 2022 NFL Season in the matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the Los Angeles Chargers, Kenneth Walker executed a remarkable 74-yard touchdown run. You can watch the video of this play [here](https://youtu.be/W60saTZAqwA?si=ImVlAaErVoqcfJIX). Utilizing the sensor tracking data available from the [Kaggle Big Data Bowl 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2024/data), I have transformed this tracking data into visualizations and textual content, which have been uploaded to AWS S3. These assets are then integrated into our chatbot to animate the discussed play, as demonstrated below. Key here is we need to look for the farme number and then based on that we can provide image and text path with respected frame number to chatbot and craft our desired query and improve the game plays strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "After transforming sensor data, a custom visualization can be seen [here](https://nfl-big-data-bowl-2024.s3.amazonaws.com/game_plays/2022102309_3809/animation.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the animation a defense coach could ask question such as:\n",
    "1. Why did our defense allow such a significant gain on this play, and how can we adjust our players' positions to prevent similar occurrences?\n",
    "2. Which defensive player had the highest likelihood to tackle but failed, and what can be done to improve their efficiency?\n",
    "3. How can we reposition our linebackers to better fill the gaps and prevent the ball carrier from breaking through?\n",
    "4. Is there a way to increase pressure on the quarterback by shifting our defensive line or changing the blitz pattern?\n",
    "5. Given the speed and direction of the offensive players, how can we anticipate the play's development in the next frame and adjust accordingly?\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions may differ depending on the Frame path we provide in ascending order; the chatbot will remember your previous responses and can suggest a strategy accordingly\n",

       "**You:** Why did our defense allow such a significant gain on this play, and how can we adjust our players' positions to prevent similar occurrences? <br> **NFL Vision:** Based on the play description and the image provided, it appears that the significant gain on the play resulted from a breakdown in the defensive execution. Here are some potential reasons for the breakdown and suggestions for adjustments:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Gap Discipline: The defensive line and linebackers may have failed to maintain their gap responsibilities. Ensuring that each player focuses on their assigned gap can prevent running lanes from opening up.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Edge Containment: Your outside linebackers (Khalil Mack #52 and Kyle Van Noy #8) are responsible for setting the edge and containing the run to the outside. It's possible that the edge was not properly contained, allowing the running back to get to the outside and up the field. Emphasizing edge containment in practice and possibly adjusting alignments to widen the OLBs could help.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Tackling: Missed tackles can lead to big plays. Ensuring that your players use proper tackling technique and take appropriate angles to the ball carrier is crucial.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Safety Support: Your safeties (Derwin James #3 and Nasir Adderley #24) are the last line of defense. They must be able to read the play quickly and come up to support the run defense. It's possible they were too deep or did not react quickly enough. Adjusting their initial alignment or improving their play recognition could help.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Defensive Line Penetration: Your nose tackles (Austin Johnson #98 and Sebastian Joseph #69) and defensive tackle (Otito Ogbonnia #93) need to be able to disrupt the offensive line's blocking scheme. If they're getting pushed back or not occupying enough blockers, it creates space for the running back. Focus on improving their technique to hold the point of attack or penetrate into the backfield.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Linebacker Play: Your inside linebackers (Drue Tranquill #49 and Kenneth Murray #9) need to quickly diagnose the play and fill the running lanes. If they're getting blocked out or misreading the play, it can result in a big gain. Work on their read-and-react skills and shedding blocks.\n",
       "\n",
       "For adjustments, consider the following:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Evaluate whether your OLBs are positioned appropriately to set the edge against the run.\n",
       "- Ensure your ILBs are quick to diagnose plays and fill gaps aggressively.\n",
       "- Train your safeties to provide quicker run support while still being mindful of play-action or deep threats.\n",
       "- Work on defensive line techniques to ensure they can hold their ground and occupy blockers.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember, specific adjustments may vary based on the overall defensive scheme and the strengths and weaknesses of individual players. Analyzing game film will provide more insights into what went wrong and how to correct it. Based on the information provided and the image, it seems that the ball has been snapped and Kenneth Walker (#9), the running back, is carrying the ball with a high likelihood of making a significant gain based on the expected play result shown in the image.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the defense, focusing on the players closest to the action is crucial:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Sebastian Joseph (#69), the nose tackle, is only 1.25 yards from the ball with a pressure tackling probability of 46%, indicating he's in a strong position to attempt to stop the run.\n",
       "- Austin Johnson (#98), another defensive lineman, is 2.18 yards away with a pressure tackling probability of 32.95%. He should be ready to assist Joseph or fill a gap if the runner breaks through the line.\n",
       "\n",
       "The linebackers, such as Drue Tranquill (#49) and Kenneth Murray (#9), should be prepared to read the play and react quickly to fill any gaps or pursue the ball carrier if he gets past the defensive line. Their pressure tackling probabilities are 22% and 18%, respectively, suggesting they are in positions where they may be able to assist if the play develops towards them.\n",
       "\n",
       "The outside linebackers, Khalil Mack (#52) and Kyle Van Noy (#8), have low-pressure tackling probabilities (4.48% and 4.35%, respectively), but they must contain the edges to prevent the running back from bouncing outside for a large gain. They should also be ready to pursue from the backside if the play cuts back.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lastly, the secondary, including Michael Davis (#43) and Derwin James (#3), show no pressure tackling probability, indicating they're likely in coverage or a deeper zone. However, they must be vigilant for a breakaway run and be ready to provide deep support if the runner gets through the first two levels of defense.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the defensive line needs to hold their ground and try to shed blocks quickly, the linebackers must read the play and react swiftly, and the secondary should be prepared for downfield support. Communication and gap discipline will be essential to prevent a big play. Based on the provided tactical insights and spatial analysis, here's an approach to optimize your defense strategy:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Leverage Closest Defenders**: Drue Tranquill (49) and Otito Ogbonnia (93) are closest to the ball carrier with high-pressure tackling probabilities. They should be the primary tacklers.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Coordinate Backups**: Kenneth Murray (9) is also close enough to assist. He should be ready to fill in if the primary tackle attempt by either Tranquill or Ogbonnia fails.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Containment and Coverage**: With Nasir Adderley (24) and Asante Samuel (26) being farther away, they should focus on secondary containment to prevent a breakaway if the initial tackles are missed. They can also cover any potential receivers in case of a pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Communication and Gap Control**: Ensure that players like Khalil Mack, Kyle Van Noy, Austin Johnson, and Sebastian Joseph maintain gap integrity and communicate effectively to prevent offensive linemen from creating large running lanes.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Anticipate Offense's Next Move**: Considering the down and distance, anticipate whether the offense might run or pass and adjust your defensive formation accordingly. If it's likely a passing down, ensure your secondary is prepared for coverage; if a run is expected, your linebackers and linemen should be ready to stop the run.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Use the Sideline**: Since the play is moving to the right end, defenders should use the sideline as an extra defender by funneling the ball carrier towards it.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Watch for Offensive Player Movements**: Be mindful of the offense's movements and react quickly to any changes in their formation or the direction of the play.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Adjustments Post-Snap**: After the snap, the defenders must read their keys and adjust their approach based on the unfolding play.\n",
       "\n",
       "Implementing these insights should improve your defensive effectiveness on this play. Remember, successful defense relies on quick decision-making, effective communication, and disciplined execution by all players involved. Based on the information and image provided, it appears you are analyzing a play where the offense is executing a run to the right end. Here are some considerations for your defense:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Defensive Player Alignment: Ensure that your defensive players are correctly aligned to respond to the run. Your defensive linemen and linebackers should be prepared to fill gaps and prevent the running back from finding an open lane.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Player (69) Sebastian Joseph's Position: As the closest defender to the ball carrier, Joseph should maintain gap integrity but also be ready to disengage from any blocks and move laterally to make a tackle. Considering his current velocity and angle of approach, he may need to adjust his trajectory to close the distance more effectively.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Player (98) Austin Johnson's Role: Johnson, given his position and momentum, should work in tandem with Joseph to box in the running back. His job will be to constrict the running lane and force the running back either inside, where there's help, or to slow down, allowing for pursuit from the backside defenders.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Player (93) Otito Ogbonnia's Task: Ogbonnia's current movement is away from the play's direction. He needs to redirect and pursue from the backside to prevent cutback lanes and be part of the tackle if the play reverses field.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Secondary Support: Your defensive backs, particularly the safeties, need to be aware of the run and come up in run support quickly while maintaining coverage responsibilities in case of a play-action pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Tackling Fundamentals: Emphasize the importance of tackling fundamentals to your players. They should aim to keep their heads up, wrap up the ball carrier, and drive through the tackle to ensure the runner is brought down.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Communication: Make sure your players are communicating pre-snap reads and any motion or shifts by the offense to ensure everyone is aware of their responsibilities and can react quickly to the play.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember, each player's positioning, speed, and angle of approach will be crucial in successfully defending against this running play. Adjustments should be made in real-time based on the offense's formation and movements. Based on the provided image and data, it appears that the defense is facing a singleback offensive formation. The offense seems to have successfully executed a play that resulted in a significant gain, possibly even a touchdown, by the player with jersey number 9.\n",
       "\n",
       "From a defensive strategy standpoint, considering the positions and movements of the players, it's clear that the defense needs to adjust to better contain such plays in the future. Here are some suggestions:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Defensive Linemen (69-Sebastian Joseph, 98-Austin Johnson, and 93-Otito Ogbonnia): These players need to maintain gap integrity to prevent running lanes from opening up. They should focus on reading their keys and reacting quickly to the snap to close down spaces that the offense might exploit.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Linebackers (8-Kyle Van Noy and others not specified in the image): The linebackers should stay disciplined in their assignments, whether that's filling gaps against the run or dropping into coverage. In this scenario, if the play was a run, they need to quickly diagnose and flow to the ball. If it was a pass, they should ensure tight coverage on any potential receiving threats in their zones.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Secondary (Corners and Safeties): The secondary must communicate effectively and maintain coverage to prevent long gains. It's important for them to provide support in run defense as well when necessary, but without compromising their primary responsibilities in pass coverage.\n",
       "\n",
       "The image indicates that there were missed tackles and perhaps a lack of coordination among the defensive players. Emphasizing tackling fundamentals and ensuring each player understands their role in the defensive scheme can help prevent such breakdowns in the future.\n",
       "\n",
       "It would be beneficial to review the film of this play to identify specific breakdowns in assignments or technique that led to the offensive success, and then address those issues in practice. Based on the information provided and the image, it appears that the defense is currently in a situation where the offense has a single back formation and there's a play in progress directed towards the right end for a significant gain.\n",
       "\n",
       "Looking at the defensive players' positions and movements:\n",
       "\n",
       "- (93) Otito Ogbonnia, a defensive tackle, is 1.99 yards away from the offense player (87) Noah Fant, moving west-southwest and looking west. He's running at a speed of 0.04 yards/second.\n",
       "- (52) Khalil Mack, an outside linebacker, is 2.17 yards away, moving southwest by west and looking in the same direction, running at a speed of 0.01 yards/second.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given these details, Otito Ogbonnia is in a better position to apply pressure due to his closer proximity and higher speed relative to Khalil Mack. However, since Noah Fant is stationary, it's crucial to consider the potential for a pass play or a block that Fant might execute.\n",
       "\n",
       "The defensive strategy should focus on maintaining coverage integrity while also ensuring that the defensive line and linebackers are ready to react to any run plays or to apply pressure if it's a pass play. The secondary should stay alert for any receivers going deep or crossing routes that might exploit the gaps between defenders.\n",
       "\n",
       "With the current setup, it would be wise for the defense to maintain gap discipline and ensure that the linebackers and safeties are ready to provide support in case of a breakthrough by the running back or a tight end release. Communication among the defensive players is key to adapt to the unfolding play and to ensure that assignments are maintained to prevent a large gain. Sorry, I don't have information on that. Based on the image provided, it looks like we have a play where the offense is in a SINGLEBACK formation and the defense is set up with 2 Outside Linebackers (OLB), 1 Nose Tackle (NT), 2 Cornerbacks (CB), 2 Safeties (FS), 2 Inside Linebackers (ILB), and 1 Defensive Tackle (DT). The offensive player (84) - Colby Parkinson, a tight end for the Seattle Seahawks, has the ball and is moving south with significant speed and momentum.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this scenario, the closest defensive players are:\n",
       "\n",
       "- (93) Otito Ogbonnia, who is moving west-southwest and has a low chance of making the tackle given his current momentum and angle.\n",
       "- (69) Sebastian Joseph, moving south-southwest and also with a low chance of making the tackle due to his positioning and relative velocity.\n",
       "- (52) Khalil Mack, moving southwest by west, has a slightly better angle but is still unlikely to make the tackle based on his current speed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the relative velocities and angles of approach, it seems that the defense is at a disadvantage. To counter this, the defense should focus on adjusting their angles of pursuit to close the gap more effectively. Players like Mack (52) should aim to redirect their path to intersect with Parkinson's trajectory, ideally aiming for a point further downfield to meet him.\n",
       "\n",
       "The safeties and cornerbacks not shown in the immediate play area should be converging on Parkinson as well, providing support to the linebackers and linemen to either slow him down or force him out of bounds.\n",
       "\n",
       "Communication among the defensive players is key to coordinate their movements and ensure they're all working towards containing the offensive player's advance. Additionally, defensive players should be ready to adjust their approach based on any moves Parkinson makes, maintaining leverage and forcing him into areas where he has less room to maneuver. Based on the provided image and information, it seems we are analyzing a play where the offense is running a play to the right end with player (74) Jake Curhan, who has significant momentum and force. The closest defensive players are (98) Austin Johnson, (8) Kyle Van Noy, and (26) Asante Samuel.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's what we can infer:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Player (1) D'Wayne Eskridge is barely moving, which could indicate a decoy or setup for a play-action.\n",
       "- Player (8) Kyle Van Noy is in close proximity to Eskridge but also not moving fast, suggesting he may be in coverage or waiting to read the play.\n",
       "- Player (98) Austin Johnson is moving in a direction that could potentially intersect with Curhan's path, but his speed is low.\n",
       "- Player (26) Asante Samuel is further away with a slightly higher speed, possibly in a coverage position.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the scenario, here are some potential strategies:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Player (98) Austin Johnson should adjust his angle to close the gap on Curhan more quickly, aiming to disrupt the blocking scheme or tackle the ball carrier.\n",
       "- Player (8) Kyle Van Noy might need to read whether Eskridge is a threat to receive a pass or if he's a decoy. Depending on the read, Van Noy could either maintain coverage or assist in run defense.\n",
       "- Player (26) Asante Samuel should stay alert for any changes in Eskridge's movement that could signal a late play development.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember, this analysis assumes a static moment in time, and football is dynamic. Player positions, speeds, and directions will change as the play develops. Defensive players should always be ready to adjust to the evolving situation on the field. Based on the provided image and information, it appears you're analyzing a play where the offense is in a SINGLEBACK formation, and the defense is set up with 2 Outside Linebackers (OLB), 1 Nose Tackle (NT), 2 Cornerbacks (CB), 2 Safeties (FS), 2 Inside Linebackers (ILB), and 1 Defensive Tackle (DT).\n",
       "\n",
       "The key players involved from the defense are:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Sebastian Joseph (69), NT: Positioned to potentially engage with the offensive player Charles Cross (67), who is an offensive tackle.\n",
       "- Drue Tranquill (49), ILB: Moving to potentially assist in a play that is developing to the west-northwest.\n",
       "- Otito Ogbonnia (93), DT: Closest to the offensive player Charles Cross (67) and moving in a direction that could intersect with Cross's path.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the scenario, the defensive strategy should focus on containing the running back and preventing a breakthrough. Considering the momentum and angle of approach of the defensive players, they should aim to close the gaps and force the play towards the sideline or into the waiting arms of their teammates.\n",
       "\n",
       "Joseph (69), given his low speed and kinetic energy, might not be the primary tackler in this scenario but should focus on controlling his gap and possibly drawing a double team to free up a linebacker or safety to make the play.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tranquill (49), with higher momentum and speed, should be tracking the ball carrier's movement and preparing to make a tackle or assist in the play. His angle of approach suggests he may have a clear path to the ball carrier if he anticipates the play correctly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ogbonnia (93), as the closest defender to the offensive player Cross (67), should maintain leverage and try to disrupt the blocker's path or shed the block quickly to apply pressure.\n",
       "\n",
       "The defense should also be aware of the potential for misdirection or a play-action pass, given the offensive formation and the movement of the players. Communication between the defensive players will be crucial to adjust to any changes once the ball is snapped.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember, in real-time situations, the defensive coordinator and position coaches would adjust these strategies based on the specific talents and tendencies of their players, the opponent's offense, and the game situation. Based on the provided image and data, it appears that Kenneth Walker (Offense Player #9) is currently not moving, which suggests a potential play just started or is about to start. Sebastian Joseph (Defense Player #69) and Austin Johnson (Defense Player #98) are the closest defensive players to him, with both moving in a south-southwest direction.\n",
       "\n",
       "To effectively counter the offensive play, considering the proximity and movements:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Sebastian Joseph (#69) should adjust his trajectory to close the gap between himself and Kenneth Walker (#9) more efficiently, possibly by angling his approach more directly towards Walker's expected path if he starts moving east by south as indicated.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Austin Johnson (#98), given his current momentum and force, could also reorient his movement to provide a secondary layer of defense should Walker manage to evade Joseph (#69).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. It's important to note that the diagram indicates a strong defense area to the right side of the field (from the defensive perspective), so ensuring that the defensive line maintains its integrity while the linebackers and safeties are prepared to adapt to any cutback runs or change of direction by the running back is crucial.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Communication between the defensive players is key. They need to be aware of each other's positions to avoid gaps in the defense and to ensure proper containment of the offensive player's potential running lanes.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Lastly, the defensive backs should be ready to provide support if Walker breaks through the front line, with an emphasis on tackling fundamentals to bring him down effectively if he gets into open space.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember to adapt these suggestions based on the actual unfolding of the play and the reactions of the offensive team. Based on the information and the image provided, it appears that the defense is currently set up in a situation where the offense has a strong chance of advancing the ball. The offensive player (72)-Abraham Lucas is moving at a higher speed and has greater momentum compared to the closest defensive players.\n",
       "\n",
       "To counter this, the defensive strategy should focus on closing the gaps and ensuring that the players with the best chance to make a stop are in position to do so. For instance:\n",
       "\n",
       "- (98)-Austin Johnson, who is 2.04 yards away from the offensive player and has a low chance of making the tackle, should continue to pursue but also anticipate the runner's path and try to force the play back inside where there is more defensive help.\n",
       "- (93)-Otito Ogbonnia, despite being further away, might be able to use his momentum to assist in the tackle or at least slow down the offensive player for others to assist.\n",
       "- (69)-Sebastian Joseph and (8)-Kyle Van Noy should work to contain the play, ensuring that they don't over-pursue and leave running lanes open.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's important to communicate clearly and ensure that each player knows their role in this scenario, whether it's to tackle, contain, or assist. The defensive players should aim to reduce the offensive player's momentum by closing in quickly and securely making the tackle. Coordination among the defenders to fill gaps and support each other is key to stopping the play effectively. Based on the image provided, it appears to be a breakdown of a particular play from an American football game. The offense is set up in a Singleback formation, which typically involves one running back lined up behind the quarterback, who is under center. The defense appears to be in a formation with 2 Outside Linebackers (OLB), 1 Nose Tackle (NT), 2 Cornerbacks (CB), 2 Safeties (FS & SS), 2 Inside Linebackers (ILB), and 1 Defensive Tackle (DT).\n",
       "\n",
       "The graphic indicates the movement of players and their proximity to each other during the play. The arrows show the direction players are moving, and the lines between players indicate potential tackles or assists. The color coding represents the likelihood of a defensive player making a tackle, with red indicating a good chance and blue a low chance.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the defense, it's crucial to analyze the gaps between players and adjust positioning to minimize the space the offense can exploit. For instance, if a running back is finding success in certain areas, linebackers may need to shift their focus and fill those gaps more aggressively. Additionally, the secondary (cornerbacks and safeties) should ensure they maintain coverage to prevent any deep passes or support the front seven in stopping the run.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this scenario, the defense should assess why there was a significant gain on this play and make adjustments to improve their containment and tackling. This could involve better gap control, improved communication among players, and ensuring that each defender understands their responsibility, whether it's maintaining edge containment or providing help in pass coverage. <br><br>"
